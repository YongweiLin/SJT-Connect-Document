#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

Communications:
 * We would be using facebook messenger for our main channel of communication
 * We expect to communicate on a daily basis within our team
 * Our main channel of communication with the partner will be via email and Skype meetings (except for the first meeting which
 would be in person)
 
Meetings:
 Team leads in each team (Front End and Back End) would be responsible for holding weekly team meetings and keeping track of
 the team’s progress throughout the project. The team lead would also be responsible for making sure each team member attends
 meetings and completes his/her deadline. In the case that a member fails to attend meeting without valid reason the team lead
 should report to the rest of the team and if the situation worsen, report to the TA/professor.
 
Conflict Resolution:

* A team member is not meeting the deadline.
	We will talk with the member and offer help. If the workload assigned to the member is too much, other teammates will help
  finish only part of the work. We will not directly take over a large proportion without communication.

* A team member is not answering the emails/texts.
	We will send out more messages in a polite and constructive way.
If necessary, we will try to find the team member in person. We are going to talk with the professors after we try both ways
above.

* A team member finished a large portion of the project without consulting with anyone else.
This situation may happen when the design of our project is too simple. In this case, we will implement more features to add
complexity to the project.
Each of the team member will participate in the code review to check if there are problems/bugs with the code this member has
finished.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * Every Thursday in-person during tutorials
 * Weekly reports on team progress
 * According the needs of the product we would split into sub-teams and each sub-team will have its own weekly meetings/coding 
 sessions
 * Coding reviews will not be conducted in person but each pull request will have to be reviewed by a member of the team

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Trello
   * We are using Trello to keep track of different tasks and it’s deadlines
   * During each team meeting each sub-team would determine the priority of its tasks according to the project requirements.
   * Tasks would be assigned to team members during each sub-team meeting

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * 1. Define user requirements and the core features that would be present in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
 * 2. Define the length of an iteration/sprint 
 * 3. Define a regular meeting schedule between the whole team and the partner, and also a meeting schedule within the team
 * 4. Research and choose the main technology stacks that would be used to build the application
 * 5. Divide the team up into sub-teams and decide what each sub-team would be responsible for (front end, back end .etc)
 * 6. For the whole team and each sub-team layout an approximate schedule and plan for each module of the app to be completed

User stories:
Core features of MVP
As a resident/visitor, I would like to click on the building I am currently in on an interactive map so that I can receive
information regarding it and check-in.
As a staff, I would like to see a head-count for the number of people in respective buildings so I can plan different events
for different buildings. 
As a resident, I would like to be able to search for events/programs in the St.James Town area (according to name/according to
building) so that I can get to know what events are happening in my area
Add-on features:
As a staff, I would like to add events via the admin page embedded in the application so I can modify the fileMaker database
and Google Calendar simultaneously.
As a staff, I would want to be able to see residents’ interest in events so that I can plan ahead for the head count of
respective events.
As a resident, I would want to be able to login to the application with my library card so that I can indicate my interest for
different events


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * User Stories: allows us to get a precise understanding of the purpose and goals the product is trying to achieve
 * Link to similar applications(for interface design): allows the partners and the team to get an idea of what the application
 would look like 
 * UML: Allows the team to get an overview of the structure of the main application
 * Testable modules: Allows the team to be able to give constant updates to partners as each module would be fully tested and
 usable when it is completed.
