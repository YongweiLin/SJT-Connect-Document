## SJT Connect (St James Town Connect)
CSC301, Winter 2019, team project.

SJT Connect is a mobile application written for the St. James Town Community.  The app aims to provide visitors/residents of St. James Town with more information regarding the area and an easy way to register the communityâ€™s events.

## Background and Goals:

Officially, approximately 17,000 people live in St. James Town. For a long time, people here have no easy way to access information about the services provided by the town or sign up for the events held by the community.



SJT Connect is here to solve this problem!


SJT Connect aims to provide a cross-platform (iOS and Android) application that would serve as a quick and easy way for users to access the service and information St. James Town has to offer. Through this application, we hope that it could help create a sense of community within the area and open up a wide range of possibilities for such mobile services to be grown.


## Main Features:

1. Interactive Map for each building in the St. James Town area.
